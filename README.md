# 🌐 Network Programming Project

## 📄 Description
This project was developed as part of a university **Computer Networks (ENCS3320)** course. It focuses on **network troubleshooting, socket programming, and real-time communication** using **TCP and UDP protocols**. The project consists of three main tasks:

1. **Network Diagnostic Tools**: Using and analyzing network commands like `ipconfig`, `ping`, `tracert`, `nslookup`, and `telnet`, as well as capturing DNS traffic using **Wireshark**.
2. **TCP-based Web Server**: Implementing a simple **multi-threaded web server** that serves both **English and Arabic webpages**, handles HTTP requests, and manages redirections for unavailable resources.
3. **UDP-based Trivia Game**: A multiplayer **real-time trivia game** using **UDP socket programming**, where the server broadcasts questions, collects answers, and tracks scores.

## 🚀 Features
-  **Network Troubleshooting**: Analyzing network connectivity and performance.
-  **Web Server Implementation**: Serving multilingual web content via **socket programming**.
-  **Multiplayer Trivia Game**: Real-time question-answer interaction over **UDP sockets**.
-  **Data Capture & Analysis**: Monitoring **DNS messages** with **Wireshark**.
-  **Real-time Leaderboard**: Live scoring and player ranking system.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python** (Socket Programming & Multithreading)
- **Wireshark**  (Network Traffic Analysis)
- **Command-Line Network Tools** (`ping`, `tracert`, `nslookup`, etc.)
